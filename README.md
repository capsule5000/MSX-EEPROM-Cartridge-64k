# MSX-EEPROM-Cartridge-64k

MSX EEPROM CARTRIDGE 64K, is a cartridge with a programmable EEPROM up to 64K, to add ROMS of small capacity and without mapper. This board accepts the EEPROMS 27c128 (128Kbits = 16Kbytes), 27c256 (256Kbits = 32Kbytes) and the 27c512 (512Kbits = 64Kbytes).
The type of file that can be recorded in these EEPROMS can only be ROM extension. Any other extension type DSK or CAS will not be valid unless through some other external program, they can be converted to a ROM extension.
It incorporates an adapter that facilitates the programming of the eeprom without having to remove the integrated circuit. By inserting the cartridge into the adapter, this in turn has some pins at the bottom that are compatible with universal programmers type TL866II plus.
